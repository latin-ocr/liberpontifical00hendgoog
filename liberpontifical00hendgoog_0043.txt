· os Westminster in the accounts of the Clerk of the Great

XVardrobe,⁸ Thomas de Usifler.

XXVIII.

The Pontifical of clifford Bishop of London 1406—1426. ·
now in the Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,
n0.79.

This magnificent. volume, by far the most splendid of all
comprised in this list, was the property of clifford Bishop of
London whose arms are emblazoned in the illumination
in two places.

The Pontifical very closely agrees with the previous London
.Pon1'·‚ifica.l, Lansdowne MS. 451, (above no. xxvi) but in the
profession -of obedience the Bishop of 'London is not named.

Like that Manuscript it has duplicate Forms of Offices.
