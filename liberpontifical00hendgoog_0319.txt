This formis found almost identieally in three PontifieaIS,
MS Claud. A. ΙΙΙ in the Brit-,ish Museum, the Pontifieal of
Arehbishop Robert. at Rouen, an'd that of Arehbishop Becket
at· Douai. ln the first· of these is a marginal note, “ Coronatio
AEtheldredi Regis Anglosaxonum.’' lt differs from⁴ the Office
in Dunstan’s Pontifieal and that in‘ MS 0000. 146 only in
slight additions to the rubrica.

This Offiee has been printed in Selden’s “ Titles of Honour,”
and in Taylor's “Glory of Regality;” but imperfectly‚ as a
leaf is lost from the English MS. It is here given complete
from the two MSS now in Franco. ·

It may be worth while adding, that. as far as the Pontifieals
gn, the Coronation Forma divide into four classes :—

( a .) saee. viii. ix. x. ineunt.

Leofrie A.
