MS 146 Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; fol. 61-329.

This Pontifical is bound up with some other pontifical
OfficeS, described below number xiii, which belonged to
Sampson Bishop of Worcester3 in whose time the whole may
have formed a single book.

This part of the volume appears to be a tenth century
manuscript. The initial letters are very plain. There are
no illuminations.

In the hand-writing, and the alternate red and green lines
of the rubricS, and in the contractione, it very closely cor-
responds with the J umieges MS just described.

The Benedictional which forms part of the volume, must
be of a much later date, as one of the Benedictions is for
the translation of S. AEthelwold.

The following Benediction would show this part to be a
Winchester book, and also bears upon' the question of its
date :—

“ Benedictio in Quinta Feria de Sanctis in Ecclesia Wentana
quiescentibus.

“ Deus, qui sanctam loci istius ecclesiam pio labore beati
Birini episcopi olim consecratam, meritis saneti confessoris
tui antistitis Swithuni moderno tempore dignatus es multiplici
miraculorum privilegio glorificare, &e.”

The English saints occur-ring in the Benedictional, are
AElphege, Cuthbert, Augustine, Etheldreda, and Swithin,
AEthelwold3 of the two last there are Benedictions for the
Dies natalis and the Dies translationis.

In the form for Ordeal there are Anglo— Saxou versions

of the adjurationS. .
