Pontificals os Enylish and Scotch Use. xxxvii

Appendix to the 2nd volume of the York Missal‚ Surtees
Society, vol. lx. and the Manual Offices‚ in the Appendix to
the reprint of the York Manual, vol. lx. in the same series.

I wil‘l only repeat the conviction which I have elsewhere
expressed, that this Pontifical was compiled or rather copied ·

from one compiled without any reference to the “Use of
Bangor.‘'

Pontifical of De Martivall‚ Bishop of Salisbury 1315-
1329 (Godwyn).

Now in the Bodleian Library ; Rawlinson MSS. O. 400.

In consideration of its importance as the sole relic of any
Pontifical belonging to a Bisbop of Salisbury since the time
of Bishop Osmund, this MS, which is but a small fragment,
is printed at length in the Appendix to this volume. ·

British·Museum; Harleian MSS. 561. Saec. xiv.

This is also a fragment. It contains :—

1. Alterations to be made in the Office of the MasS, when
a Bishop was celebrant.

2. Benedictio Virginum.

3. Benedictio Sanctimonialis non Virginis post vel infra
annum probationis,

4. Benedictio Regis et Reginae.

5. De Ordinibus conferendis, breaking off in the Ordination
of DeaconS.

The Coronation Office is something between the Liber
Regalis and the form printed from Mm. iii. 21. Cambridge
· Univ. Library by Mr Maskell.

The Pontifical is assigned to Winchester from the Form
of Benediction ofNunS. ’ ⁴ κ ’
