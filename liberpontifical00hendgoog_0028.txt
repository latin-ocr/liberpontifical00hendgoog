The Office for blessing Palms 1 cannot find elsewhere. It
may be an insertion of Leofric, though in the midst of
extracts from the Ordines Romani. It is immediately pre·
ceded by the words, “Sabbato ante Palmas Domnus Papa.
eleemosynam dat,” which are found in the Ordo printed by
Hittorp‚ ²¹⁵ on which see the account which follows of Vitell.
E xii.

The remaining two Office8‚ those for Holy Thursday and
Good Friday are taken verbally from the same Ordo, which
may be thought to have been brought from Burgundy by
Leofric.

Cotton MSS. Vitellius E xii. British Museum.

This MS is one of the volumes of the Cotton Library that
suffered from the fire 1n 1731. It is now only a· collection of
fragments which are in great disorder.

Part· of the volume, from 116-160, consists of fragments,
the remains of an Ordo RomanuS‚ to which are appended the
Benedictions of the imag-es of S. Peter and S. Swithin, some
prayerS, addresses in the Offices for the Sick, and a. Litany.

This Ordo Romanus is identical with one printed by
Hittorp in his ‘⁶ de Divinis Catholicae Ecclesiae Officiis.'’

ὓ An account of this Ordo printed by 'Hittorp will ‘be found in the
Tubingen Theological Quarterly for 1862 in an article by Dr Meckel
. 51-53.
pplt has been conjectured by some, but on very questionable grounds, that
the Ordo in its present state came from the hands of Beruoldus of constance.
Dr Rock thinks that perhaps it was adapted to the Cologne use. I am
indebtcd for this note as wellas for much else, to Mr E. Bi ishop of Esher,
who adds his opinion that the MS described by Morinus de ordinationibus

’ p. 257 of the lst pagination, is an earlier and a simpler form of the same

Ordo.
