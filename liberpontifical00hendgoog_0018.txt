in⁴the F rauco-Saxon style of the time of ‘Oharles the Bald,
who reigned till A. D. 877.

The services in the Pontifical part of the Sacramentary
have generally no rubrics or very short ones. They agree

, with the simplest'and earliest Forms. They are simpler

even than those in Egbert3 but it is to be remembered, that
this is not properly a Pontifical.

Of the Masses contained in this part of the volume, I have
found 250 in the Sacramentaries edited by Muratori, viz.
. 234 in the Gregorian, 20 in the Gelasian, and 1 in the Leonine.
Of, the remainder, 16 occur in the Sacramentary edited by
Menard, and 6 in the Sacramentary of Alcuin as edited by
Pamelius3 4 in other Sacramentaries in the same volume 3 4
are mixed, and 17 1 have as yet been unable to find in any
early Collection.

Of the Masses in the Gregorian Sacramentary of Muratori,
all but 19 are in Leofric. Of the other Offices in the MS„

some are wholly from the Gelasian, and one or two much
nearer to the Leonine than to the Gelasian or Gregorian.

It should be added, that the book commences, with the
Canon of the Mass, that it has in the margin the Epistlespnd
Gospels of each day, with the variables of theMass for the
choir 3' all in the original hand. -

On the covering folio is written :—

“Hunc missalem Leofricus episcopus dat Ecclesiae sancti
Petri apostoli in Exonia ad utilitatem successorum suorum.
Si quis illum inde abstulerit, aeternae subjaceat maledictioni.
Fiat, fiat. Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobiS.”

A fac-simile of some of the leaves is given by Mr Westwood.

Very little has hitherto been printed from this Sacramentary.
