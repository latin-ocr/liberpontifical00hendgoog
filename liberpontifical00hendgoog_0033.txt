Pontificals of Enylisk and Scotch Une. xxix

The Form for SynodS, to last four· days, appears to have
exercised but little influence on the later Forms. In later
Pontificals there are two Forms for holding Synods‚ each to
last for three days only; one appearing in various Pontificals
from the 12th to the l5th century, which is printed in Wilkins
4. 7843 the other, which is found in the MSS numbered 13 and
34 in this list, and which has been printed by Mr Maskell.

I have not found elsewhere the following rubrio with
regard to colours and material of Eucharistic vestments‚
which is added to the “Examinatio ordinandi Episcopi,” as
given in Hittorp.

Silvester papa inter cetera constituit, ut sacrificium altaris
non in serico aut tincto panno quisquam celebrare praesumat,
sed in puro lineo ab episcopo consecratu, sicut corpus Domini
nostri J esu Christi 1n sindone linea sepultum fuit
