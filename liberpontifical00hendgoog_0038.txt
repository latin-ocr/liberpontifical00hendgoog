British Museum; Tiberius. Β viii. Saec. xii.

This volume, which is magnificently written, though
without ornamented capitals or illuminations, was originally
written for some Suffragan of the Province of Canterbury.
This appears from the Decretum de Electo Episcop0‚ and the
Examinatio Episcopi, wherein it agrees with the Magd. Coll.
MS. above described (n0. xviii.) It became afterwards the
property of a Bishop of Glasgow, as is shown, just as in the
case of the Exeter book, by the Abbot’s profession, the name
of the original Diocese having been erased and that of
Glasgow inserted in a hand of the same period.

“Vis sanctae Ecclesiae Glasguensi canonicam per omnia ‘

subjectionem exhibere.” ⁶

The only variations from the Hereford and Dublin BookS,
of any note are in the Forms for Consecration of Nuns.

In the middle of this volume is bound up the Coronation
Office for Charles V. of France‚ on which see the note'in
Maskell Monum. Rit. iii.. p. 14. Ι will only add that the
expression ‘⁶ Ut regale solium, videlicet Saxonum, Merciorum,
Nordanchimbrorum sceptra non deserat,” does not occur in
any known English Pontifical.

XXI. .

Paris, National Library, MS. Lat. 1218. Saec. xiii.

This was the Pontifical of David de Burnham Archbishop
of S. AndreWS.

It is described in the printed Catalogue merely as
‘⁶ Pontificale Anglicanu‚m‚'’ and its identification is due to the
sagacity of M. Delisle, now the *Administrateur General of
that noble Library‚ who observed at the beginning a list of
churches consecrated or reconciled by the Scottish primate.

It is a small quarto, well and correctly written, and with -

. musical notation.
