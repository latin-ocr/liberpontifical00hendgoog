Among the saints in the Litany are S. AElphege, S. Dunstan
and S. Mildred.

There is also bound up in this volume, the Coronation
Office for Henry Ι., in which it is to be noticed that the words,
Anglorum, Saxonum, Anglo-Saxonum‚ and the like, are

omitted. This is the Coronation Office found in the xiith
century Pontificals.

Pontifical of S. Thomas a Becket.

Now in the Public Library,=Douai ; MS 94.

This ⁸MS is well known, from being described in the Voyage
Litteraire of Martene and Durant. It was originally at
Marchiennes and is traditionally the Pontifical of Archbishop
Becket. The handwriting of the MS is said to be of the 12th
century, but it is certainly copied from one earlier than the

Conquest. It almost throughout verbally agrees with
Archbishop Robert’s book and Claud. A. III (Ethelred’s

Coronation Office) and with G. G. O. 146, and it has none of
the modifications found 1n all the 12th century MSS.

In the Consecratio Regis, it has. —

“hunc famulum tuum ill. quem supplici devotione ιη regem

Anglorum vel Saxonum pariter eligimus;”

and :—

“Hic totius regni Anglorum Saxonum ecclesiam deinceps
cum plebibus sibi annexis ita enutriat?

The whole Coronation form is videntical with those earlier
than the accession of Henry Ι. It will be found in the
Appendix to this Volume p. 267.
