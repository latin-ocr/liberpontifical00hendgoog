Consecratio Παρία. 269

( d. ) saee. xiv. xv,

Found in the Westminster Pontifieal, the supposed Lincoln
MS in the Cambridge University Library (Mm. iii. 21),
Lacy’s PontificaL and MS Lansdowne 451.

Of these, thebLincoln MS appears, by the additional matter
it contains, to be the latest.

The Westminster Pontifical gives this as the form used

for Edward II.

This form does not vary from the previous in the unction
and list of things delivered.
It, is printed in Mr Maskell’s “ Monumenta Ritualia.”

(e.) saec. xiv. exeunt. xv·

This is found in the ‘⁸ Liber Regalis ” and Bishop Clifford's
Pontifical. It was the form used for Richard ΙΙ.

The Liber Regalis has been printed in a volume presented
by Lord Beauchamp to the Roxburghe Olub and a full collation
of it is given by Mr Maskell in the ‘⁶ Monumenta. Ritualia.”

The Coventry and Bangor book8, Archbishop Chiehele’s
and Archbishop Bainbridge’s Pontifieals, as well as MS
Tanner 5, have no Coronation Office.
