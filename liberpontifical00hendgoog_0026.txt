xxii Pontificals os Enylish and Scotch Use.

“Credis sanctam Catholicam et Apostolicam unam esse
veram Ecclesiam &c.’'
we have in 'the margin :—

“Articulus hic de Transubstantiatione et articulus de
corporali praesentia sanguinis in novo Pontificali Anglico
inseruntur3 et in Pontificali Romano hi articuli praedjcti non
habentur.” ‚

The MS appears to have been written for an Archbishop
of Canterbury, and probably in the reign of Edward the
Confessor.

The profession of the Bishop is, to be “obediens sanctae
Dorobernensi ecclesiae.”

It is a very handsome volume, with little ornament but
very well written in one hand throughout.

The English saints named in the Litanies are, AElphege‚
Dunstan‚ Swithin, Outhbert, Guthlac‚ AEtheldrytha‚ Mildrytha,
Edward.

The expressions in the“ Consecratio Regis” are. —

“ in regem Anglorum vel Saxonum ;'’ ⁸

“ totius regni Anglo-Saxonum ; ”

“ Anglorum vel Saxonum.'’

The words “Anglicus'' and ‘·Anglo- Saxonicusss’ occur
perpetually 1n the Antiphons and Praycrs 1n this Office.

lts chief characteristics are, the great lengthening of all
the Offices by the addition of long new prayers and by insertions
in the old prayers3 by the introduction of very frequent
references to the intercession of Saints‚ far beyond any other
Pontifical.

The only Office in which this MS clearly follows earlier
MSS is that for Ordeals with which it concludes.

Several of the shorter Forms do not occur in any other
English Pontifical‚ as that “ ad ordinandum Decanum,” which
consists of two prayers nearly identical with those given
in Martene (de Rit. 2. 1 Ordo vi.) as a form for the Benediction
of an Abbot‚ from a Rheims manusc'ript.

Nasmyth's Catalogue says of this MS :—

“ Codex membranaceus, forma quadrata, in folio, ante
conquisitionem Angliae, ut videtur, scriptus.”
