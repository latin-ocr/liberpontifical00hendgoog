eighth century, except some Masses found in the Sacramentary
attributed by Pamelius to Alcuin.

Another circumstance seems to point to an early date for
this part of the Volume. In the Choral parts of the Mass
noted in the margin, only 4 Sequences are given, viz.

Feria ii. in Albis3 Caelica resonent.

Feria iii. Mater Sequentiarum.
Feria iv. Olaris vocibus.
Feria vi. Lyra.

If this is compared to the very full list of Proses or
Sequences in the Bodleian MS 775, written in the reign of
Ethelred A. D. 994-1017, and the known popularity of
Sequences in England is considered, the time when 4
Sequences in Easter week formed the whole list, must be
put a long way back. These Sequennces, with the days on
which they were sung, will be found in the App. to the 2nd
’ Volume of the York Missal ; Surtees Soc. vol. lx. p. 283. ¹*

In folio 257 of the MS occurs in a Litany :—

Ut regem Anglorum et exercitus ejus conservare digneris;

In folio 267, in another Litany, occurs what appears to be
an unique expression :—

Ut reges nostros et exercitus eorum conservare digneris.
which, if not merely a copy from some foreign Litany, may
point to a time when the “ Sceptra Saxonum, Merciorum,
Nordanchymbrorum‚’‘ to use the words of the Coronation
Office of Charles ,V. of France (Br. Mus. Cotton MSS Tib.
B. viii.) had not yet been united.

Mr Westwood in his Fac-similes of Miniatures of Anglo-
Saxon and Irish MSS, gives a long account of the MS with
fac-similes. He describes the writing as a pure Caroline
minuscule, with plain capitals about an inch high. Four
leaves of the Canon of the Mass are beautifully ornamented
