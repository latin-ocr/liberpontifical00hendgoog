xxxvi Pontificals os Enylish and Scotch Use.

The volume has been badly bound, many of the ornamented
and illuminated letters having been cut that the edges of
the volume might be gilt.

Besides some at the beginning, two leaves are lost from
the body of the book3 the first leaf of the Canon, and in the
Benedictional the folio containing from Dom. xv. to Dom. xx .
post Pentecosten. The centre of the larger illuminated
letters has been in most cases cut out. The rubrics are in many
places illegible. All the Oboral parts have musical notation.

This Manuscript contains all the ordinary Pontifical Ser·
viceS, the Offices for Special Days and also those usually
found in the Manual.

The chief interest attaching to this MS arises from the
expectation that it might enable us to determine the “ Use of
Bangor. Most of the Offices in this book are collated by
Mr Maskell in his Monumenta Ritualia, but it must be
remembered that the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass for
the Bangor Use as given in the text of his ‘⁶ Ancient Liturgy
of the Ohurch of England,'’ are not from this volume but
from a Missal‚ once belonging to Oswestry. I will only
say here, that the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass in this
Pontifical are singularly close to the Sarum form 3 and where
this Volume and the Coventry Pontifical (No, xxi.) give forms
for the same Pontifical Office, there is the closest similarity
between them. The Offices for OrderS, ad Clericum faciendum,
and Benedictio Viduae are identical in the two MSS, and that
for the Consecratio Ecclesiae very nearly so,

In the Benedictional are found forms for S. Francis (Day
and Translation) S. Dominio, S. Olair‚ and S. Bernard.

The Profession of a Nun is as follows 1-

Ego soror N. promitto stabilitatem meam et conversionem
morum meorum et obedientiam secundum regulam S. Benedicti
coram Deo et sanctis ejus. in hoc monasterio quod est con-
structum in honore Dei et sanctae Etheldredae in praesentia
domni N. Episcopi et domnae N. Abbatissae.

The Canon of the Mass and the Offices usually found in
Missals, which occur in this volume, will be found in the
