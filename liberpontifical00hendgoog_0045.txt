Pontificals of Enylish and Scotch Use. xli

Pontifieal of Ohiehele Arehhishop of Canterbury 1414-1443,
now in Trinity College Library, Cambridge.

In the form for Degrading an heretical Olerk‚ we have
fol. 214. “eopia vero hujusmodi sententiae sequitur et talis
vel consimilis esse potest.” ‚

“ In Dei nomine Amen. Nos Henrieus permissione divina
cantuariensis Archiepiseopus, totius Angliae Primas, &03² and
so elsewhere in the same Offioe and in that for the benedietion
of Grutehed Friaurs.

It is a thick Volume‚ of 299 fol. with musical notes, very
little ornament and not a handsome book. ,

It contains Peokham’s Benedictions as well as the ordinary
set, and some Offices peculiar to this Ms„ as the Form for
profession of Grutehed Friars, and that for admission of Nuus
and Friars of the order of S. Bridget.

These both lived in the same monastery, now Sion College,
ἵ founded in 1414. and the only English House of the order'.
÷ It also has duplicate forms in one instance.

Consecratio Crucis (1) in forma ouriae Romanae.

(2) ad modum Angliae.

There are very long Offioes for Enelosing Anchorites, both
male an1d female3 and. very full and various forms for
admissions into Monastie orders,

It gives the Exeter Rubrio on Colours, as well as the Sarum.

The Use of Sarum is constantly referred to, and there are
repeated notiees of the variatione between it and the Roman
Use.

In the Appendix will be found the Confirmation Serviee as
given in this MS, (which provides for two points not elsewhere
notieed‚ Confirmation on a· jour'ney and hypothetioal Con-
firmation,) and the office for laying the Foundation Stone of a
Churoh. - ·

The statement 'in the old Catalogus Generalis that this
was a Pontifioal of >the time of Philip and Mary, appearsto
have been founded , on nothing better than the title of the

Mass ‘⁶ Pro Rege et Regina.’'
