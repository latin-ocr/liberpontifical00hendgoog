Cambridge University Lffigyvfif. vi. 1. ²
This is the Pontifical of Arehbishop Bainbridge printed
in the present volume.

To the above is to be added a MS in the Library of the
Marquis of Bath at Longleat,²which h'as been shown me
by Mr BradshaW, the Librarian of the University of
Cambridge, but too late to notice in its proper place.

The volume is made up of pieces of two or three Pontifioals
of the xiiith and xivth centuries. It contains two forms for
the Dedication of a Ohurch, differing from each other ; a
Benedictional, Offioes for Ordination, for the Consecration of

’ NunS, Abbots and Abbesses, and for the Special Days.

There is nothing to indicate for what Bishops or Sees the
MSS bound together m this volume were written.
