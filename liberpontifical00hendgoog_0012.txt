viii Presace.

for consecrating an altar, occurs, ‘⁶ Dum se induit episcopua, ’

dicat psalmos ut supra in dedicatione Ecclesiae ; ’⁹ while we
have in that for the dedication of a Ohurch, “ episcopus . . .
dicat hanc orationem, Domine sancte 8ιο. ut supra in conse-
crat-ione altaris.”

This Pontifical is the latest surviving one of old
English Use, as that of Egbert published by the Surtees
Society is the earliest. It may be' remarked that
although it belonged to an Archbishop of York, it cannot
be called a Pontifical of the “Use of York.” The only
'sense in which the Term ⁸ Use ’ can be applied to Pontificals
or to the Pontifical offices they contain, is one which is
· common to them all, the ‘ Use of England ’ as opposed to the
‘ Use of Rome ’ or the ‘ Use of France ’ and the like. So, for
example, in Bishop Clifford’s Pontifical (n. 27 below) we have
‘De Consecratione Tabulae portatilis more Gallicano’ and
‘ Benedictio lapidis itinerarii secundum modum Romanae ec-
clesiae‚’ ‘ Consecratio pontificis secundum Romanam ecclesiam,'
and ‘Consecratio pontificis secundum modum Anglicanum.‘
But the Offices belonging more properly to the Missal and
Manual‚ when inserted for convenience’ sake in a Pontifical,
would of course be those of the Use of the Diocese‚ and in
such the words secundum usum Sarum and the like, would
naturally be found.

It was a serious matter to change the use of a Diocese‚ if
only from consideration of the expense of altering the Service
Books of so many Churches and Chapels3 but there was no
such difficulty in the case of the special Episcopal Offices,
which, as far as others besides the Bishop were concerned,
implied little more than perhaps a rearrangement of the
Choral parts and some changes in the Ceremonial.
