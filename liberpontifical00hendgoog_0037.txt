Trin. coll. Dublin Β. 3. 6. Saec. xii.

This MS is mutilate at the end. It corresponds throughout
verbally with the Hereford Book, so far as the two run
together. The presence of two offices not in the Hereford
book, which might apparently be taken to show that it was
written for an Archbishop of Canterbury‚ viz.

Quando Archiepiscopus pallium acceperit &c.

Quando Pallium mittitur a Roma;
are yet of no value in this respect3 the same forms are found
in the Pontifical of De Martivall Bishop of Sarum.

The only English Saint named in this book is S. AElphege.

A copy of this MS has been given me by the great
kindness of the Bishop of Brechin.

XIX.

British Museu-m3 Vesp. D xv, Saec. xii.

This is a Fragment of a Pontifical once belonging to a
Bishop of Exeter, though not written originally for him.
In the Profession for an Abbot, the name of the first Diocese
has been erased and that of Exeter inserted in a hand of
apparently the same date. ‘⁶ Vis sanctae matri Ecclesiae
· Exoniensi canonicam &c. per ‘omnia exhibere.”

Hesp. Volo.

Et dicat Episcopus. Profitere.

Ec Abbas. Ego N. Ecclesiae ill. electus Abbas profiteor
sanctae Exoniensi 0Ecclesiae ejusque vicariis canonicam &c.

,It contains the earliest Form‚ Ad recludendum Anchoritam.
