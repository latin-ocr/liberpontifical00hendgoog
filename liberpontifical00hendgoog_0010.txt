vi - Preface.

Temporibus quoque a jure statutis clericis beneficiatis et
aliis quibuscunque nostrarum civitatis et dioceseos Ebor.

· praedictae alienisque per suos ordinarios sufficienter dimissis

titulos sufficientes habentibus tam minores quam sacros
ordines' 1n locis per nos aut nostrum vicarium in spiritualibus
generalem limitandis conferendum.

Oleumque et crisma congruis loco et tempore cum sol-
lemnitate qua decet consecrandum.

Ceteraque omnia et singula quae ad officium pastorale in
praemissis seu eorum aliquo pertinent seu pertinere debent
faciendum, exercendum, expediendum et exsequendum, frater·
nitati vestrae tenore praesentium committimus potestatem.
In cujus rei testimonium sigillum nostrum praesentibus

apponi fecimus. Dat. in hospitio nostro prope Westm. ivto ’

onis anno primo.

The Collection of Offices in this Manuscript is deficient
in the following forms. It does not contain three of the
Offices referred to in the above commission.

1. For Confirmation. ι
2. For Blessingf Ohalices and any other Altar or
1 Church Vessels and ornaments or Vestments.
3. For Blessing the Oils and Chi-ism.
nor does it contain the Forms for ’
4. The Consecration of a Bishop.
5 The Coronation of a King and Quem,
Offices in which the Archbishop would xofficiate personally.

The volume in its present condition appears to be made up
of two MSS3 the lst consisting of foll. 1—108. The second
of 109—fin. On the first leaf of the first half is written in a
later hand “ prima quaterna ’⁹ -and on fol. 108 “ ultima
quaterna.”

It is said in a note on the last folio, that the volume consists
of xiii. quaternions, which is the number from 108 to the end.
In· the present volume these two halves have certainly been
misplaced. The Pontifical proper begins with fol. 114.; foll.
108-113 being a prefix containing the form for blessing the

greater holy water, as used in the consecration of Churches διο.
