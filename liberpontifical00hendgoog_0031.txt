in the appendix to this volume. It has musical notes. The
names of King William, Queen Matilda, Pope Alexander and
Archbishop Aldred will be found in the Litany. The Litany
therefore, must have been written between the years 1067-
1070 when Alexander was Pope and 'Aldred was the only
Archbishop acknowledged by the King‚ and whb therefore,
is prayed for as the Archbishop of the realm and not merely
as Archbishop of a province.

Having regard to the character of this Litany‚ and the
circumstance that it is found in a generalized and slightly
modified form in the Ely Pontifical in the library of Trinity
Oollege, described below, in immediate connection with the
Coronation Office‚ and lastly, to the prominence given in it to
Matilda,1 am led to think that it is the Litany sung at the
coronation of Matilda by Archbishop Aldred 1n 1068.

At the conclusion of the Form for consecrating a bell, is
the rubric, not found in Hittorp: —

“Tunc sub trina infusione aquae sanctae, impone ei nomen,
si velisJ’

With this may be compa1 ed the concluding rubric of the
Office in the Sarum Manual 2—-

“ Deinde aspergatur aqua benedicta, et totus populus
praesens. Et imponatur sibi nomen per sacerdotem, apponendo
manum supra et simul imponunt patrini et matrinae. Et post
presbyterum nominant suum (i. e. campanae) nomen co-
operiendo cloccam lintheoss’
