The profession specifies for the Convent; “Locus iste qui
est constructus in honore sanotae Mariae.”

The order for consecration of Nuns printed by Mr Maskell
Mon. Rit. vol. 2. 307. is a translation of the form in this
book. That English Version was given to the Convent of
Nuns of S. Mary, Winohester, by Bishop Fox, who held the
See from A. D. 1500, to 1528. -

British Museum; Lansdowne MSS. 451. Saec. xiv.

This is a very fine folio MS, perfect, with illuminations
and some eurious pictures.

It has been called from entries, the Evesham, and therefore
an Abbatial Pontifioal, and from the rubrio on Colours fol.

18. 19. where Ecclesia nostra Exon. is named, it has been
’ assigned to Exeter.

It may have belonged to Evesham after the death of its
owner, but it is in no sense an Abbatial Pontifical. And the
expression in the rubrio on Colours proves nothing. This
has been taken from some Exeter book and inserted without
alteration. It is found also in Archbishop Ohiehele's
Pontifioal, (No xxviii. infra) and CCCC 79, (No xxvii.)
totidem verbis.

The MS. was written for a Bishop of London, and would
refer only to the Use of S.· Paul’s,' so far as it 'referred to any
special Use at all.

The Widows’ profession fol. 75 is “Ego N. vidua, non
conjugata, promitto et voveo Deo et beatae Mariae et sanctis
omnibus in praesentia vestra, Reverende in Christo pater
Domine N. Londinensis Episcopo, propositum castitatis
vidualis perpetuae juxta regulam beati Pauli apostoli. · In
nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.'’

The volume also agrees throughout very closely with

CCCC. 7 9, the Pontifioal of Olifford Bishop of London.
