“Interrogati0. Vis sanctae matri Ecclesiae Scriberiensi

“ Dicat Episcopus. Profitere.

“Et Abbas. Ego ill. ecclesiae ill. electus Abbas profiteor
sanctae Seriberiensi ecclesiae ejusque vicariis canonicam
subjectionem.”

Its contents are a great medley, and it is the work of
more than one scribe. It contains homilies in Anglo-
Saxon; sermons in Latin on various ⁸matters3 capitula
of Councils, particularly fol. 201 “ Capitula concilii apud
Wintoniam celebrati,'’ printed in Wilkins, 1. 365, from this‘,
MS, where it is put under the year 1076. Also, “Poenitentis
institutio secundum decreta Normannorum praesulum ” at a
Gouncil held under the presidency of Legate Ermenfred3
placed by W ilkins in 1076, but which probably should rather
be put in 1070. Now Herman was Bishop of Salisburyonly
from 1075 to 1078. Osmund from 1078 to 1099. Considering
these dates and the ritual importance of the MS. I am fully
persuaded that so far at least as the Pontifical Offices go, it

. was written for and under the *direction of Bishop Osmund.

The Offices in this MS belonging to the Pontifical, consist
of three portions :—

1. Minor Benedictions which are to be found in almost all
the older Pontificals or Sacramentai ies

2. Forms for Holy Thursday‚ Good Friday, Easter Eve,
relic chests, altar tabernacle, for the Consecration of bells,
and for SynodS, Ember dayS, and a few minor matters.
These are verbally from the Ordo Romanus printed by
Hittorp.

3. Forms for the Benediction of⁴ Abbots, Nuus, Widows,
AbbesseS, and Ordinations of Olergy3 these verbally correspond
with the Forms of the 12th century Pontificals, and probably
may be reasonably thought the work of Bishop Osmund
himself.
