xii Pontificals os English and Scotch Use.

The volume consists of three distinct parts.

First, the original Sacramentary, which I have referred to
as Leofric A. This correspouds very closely with the
Gregorian Sacramentary edited by Muratori; more particularly
with his Codex Othobonianus.

Secondly, the Calendar and Tables, which seem to be of a
later date than the Sacramentary. The Tables commence
, Α. D. 969. (Dr Rock and Mr Westwood.) '

Thirdly‚ come additions to the old Sacramentary, not all in
one hand, of which far the larger portion at any rate were
written by direction of Bishop Leofric in A. D. 1050 or soon
after. This is referred ιο as Leofric B and described below
No. x.

Some Saints' days in the Calendar have led Dr Rock ιο
suppose that the MS may have been written, or at least used,
in Glastonbury, or in some other monastery in the west of
England; e. g.

Aug. 31 ; In Glastonie„ S. Amani, Episcopi.

Sept. 253 In Glastonia‚ S. Ceolfrithi‚ AbbatiS.

There are‘among the entries :—

Feb. 163 Ob. Brihtricus, DecanuS.

Mar. 19; Hic obiit Lifingus, Episcopus.

Nov. 93 Obitus Eadulfi, Episcopi.

Lifing was Bishop of Devonshire (Crediton) A. D. 1031—
1046. Eadulf the first Bishop of Devonshire (Tawton) A. D.
909—911 and Eadulf II. Bishop of Devonshire (Crediton)
A. D. 931 ; (Le N eve’s Fasti3 Hardy.)

The date of the original Sacramentary is not so clear.

‘In the saints invoked in the Litany‚ the latest are, as in
Egbert‚ S. Cuthbert and S. Guthla03 the last early in the
eighth century. , S. Swithin, saec. ix, and S. Dunstan‚ saec. x,
are not named.

The handwriting of this part of the Volume is thought by
competent judges to be about A. C. 930, not earlier. I am
inclined to think that it is copied from a MS dating very
early in the ninth century. There is nothing in fact in the
contents of the MS, which points to a later date than the
