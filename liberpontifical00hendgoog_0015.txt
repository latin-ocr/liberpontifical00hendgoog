Pontificals of Enylish and Scotch Uoc. xi

I.
The Pontifical of Egbert Archbishop of York.
This MS. is now in the National Library, Paris.

This Pontifical is traditionally that of Archbishop Egbert-
A. D. 735—766. If, however, this tradition is correct, the
volume is probably a copy from the Archbisbop's own
Pontifical, as the handwriting seems to belong to a period
some 150 years later.

The MS has been printed by the Surtees Society, Vol. 27,
and is described in the preface to that volume and by
Silvestre de Sacy in the “ Palaeographie Universelle.”

It seems only necessary to add in this place, that the other
ritual books referred to in this MS are—

Liber sacramentorum, p. 8, 43, 48.

Libellus in quo scripti sunt exorcismi, p. 13.

. The form for blessing oils and chrism appears to be from
some Ordo Romanus.

The only English saints referred to in the Litanies are
S. Outhbert, and S. Guthlac of Oroyland, who died at the
beginning of the 8th century.

There are double forms for the consecration of Nuns,
Widows, Marriage‚ and Blessing of Palms.

In the Blessing of Arms, p. 131, the soldiers are twice
called those ‘ Romani imperii ; ’ ‘ nostri ’⁹ being written over.

A fac-simile of a page will be found in Silvestre de Sacy.

The Sacramentary of Leofric, Bishop of Crediton, A. D.
1046—1050 3 of Exeter, A. D. 1050—1072.

This is now one of the chief treasures of the Bodleian
Library, Oxford.

This volume' and Egbert's Pontifical are without doubt the .
two most ancient ritual monuments of the early English
Church. It is strictly a Sacramentary or ‘Liber Sacra-
