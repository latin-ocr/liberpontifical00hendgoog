Presace. vii

The lst 15 folios contain the order for Reconciling a Church
or Altar. These are connected with the following by a
keyword in a later hand. Those numbered 16-48 containing
the consecration of Altars and Bell, are in original sequence.
They are connected with foll. 48-60 by a keyword in a later
hand. These contain the preface for the Consecration of an
Altar, Offices for Blessing a Hermit, Installing an Abbot,
and Blessing an Abbess. Fol. 60verso is blank and has no
keyword. , p

Foll. 61-7 2 are in sequence, containing lst. Benedictions 3 2.
Form for blessing a widow; 3rd. 3 Benedictions. On 72 verso
is written the Benediction for the Feast of S. Mary Magdalen
in a later hand. The later keyword on this fol. connects it with
f. 85. The inserted foll. 7 3-84 contain additional benedictionS,
an appendix to the form for Consecrating an Abbot, which
is referred to in the Office fol. 156 sqq, and the form ‚for
receiving an Archbishop or King. After this insertion
follows in original connection foll. 85-108‚ Consecration of
Virgins. Next, an insertion 109-113; the form for conse-
crating greater Holy Water. After which comes the original'
commencement of the MS. 114-192; the forms for Ordi-

separate quaternions3 lst; foll. 193-198, Office for the in-
clusion of a Recluse3 and, 199-fin. Dedication of a Oh urchyard.
After fol. 192 there is a cancelled leaf which ,would 'have
the keyword.

These Offices are therefore printed in conformity with this,
except so far as it was convenient to keep all the Benedictions
together, and to insert the Appendix to the office for
Consecrating an Abbot immediately after the Office itself. ’
At fol. 108 is a note; “These ben the benedictions that
lacken” and then follows the list. These have all been
added to the original MS on fol. 72 verso and 73-81.
