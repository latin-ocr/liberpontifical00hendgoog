Liber Pontificalis Gemmeticensis.

This MS is now number 362 in the Public Library of
Rouen, to which place it was brought from J umieges.

Ἀ full description of it is given in the Arcbaeologia, vol. xxv.
by Mr Gage. It will be sufficient bere to say, that ‘the initials
are plain in colours; that no gold is used3 the rubrios are
often in alternate lines of red, green, and blue3 there are
two illuminations, both of which are given in the Archoeologia,

· with a. fac-simile of the text.

It is a MS. written in England‚ which for a. time belonged
to the Bishop of Alet in Brittany. At fol. 183 is a general
form of excommunication to be pronounced by the Bishop

Lanaletensis monasterii.

v The English saints referred to in the Litanies are, S.
Birinus, S. Erconwald, and S. Cuthbert. The name of S.
Columban is alsoss found. From the illumination an argument
is drawn, by Mr Gage, that the MS is earlier than 950,
which is, I think, correct. It. seems from‘the Coronation
Office, from those for the Consecration of BishOPS, of Oils ⁶
and Obrism, to be clearly earlier than Dunstan’s Pontifical.
The Coronation' Office is identical with that in the Pontifical
of Egbert‚ and has the helmet for the orown. The Form
for Consecrating Oil is, as in Egbert' and Leofric, from an
Ordo Romanus.

, Mr Gage, however, finds a. difficulty in fixing the date of
the MS to the first half of the tenth century, from the Form
for the Benediction of tapers on the Purification being found
